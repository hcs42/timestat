- Activity filter: --filter=day:1-5 --filter=hour:8-16
    - move "between" filtering into "events"
    - maybe deprecate --ignore-activities in favor of this
- timestat switch # switch to other activity
- timestat --interactive switch
    - switch to other activity by showing the last 10 tasks
- more support for hierarchy?
    - work/x, work/y, hobby/a, hobby/b, hobby/ew/configuration
    - timestat --prefix=work/
    - TIMESTAT_PREFIX
    - --filter work
    - easy renaming for the items in the hierarchy
    - warning when a new task is created
- review statistics, nicer outputs, aggregated week information
- comments:
    - [...] mywork # fixing bug 23 -- do I want this?
- normalization:
    - intervals should use hh:mm in action files
    - -H should be the default

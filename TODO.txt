- Activity filter: --filter=day:1-5 --filter=hour:8-16
    - move "between" filtering into "events"
    - maybe deprecate --ignore-activities in favor of this
- Show errors when encountering negative intervals and unmatched stops
- merge all actionfiles when they are read (so that one can start an activity
  and another one can stop it)

- quickadd should select from existing activities:

    $ timestat quickadd ti
    "hobby/timestat" activity started
    $

    $ timestat quickadd sta
    The substring "sta" occurs in several activities. Which one do you want to
    start?
    [1] hobby/timestat
    [2] work/erlang-install
    > _

    $ timestat quickadd xx
    Substring not contained by any activity: xx
    Do you want to create a new activity called "xx"? [y/n] _

- timestat switch # switch to other activity
- timestat --interactive switch
    - switch to other activity by showing the last 10 tasks
- more support for hierarchy?
    - work/x, work/y, hobby/a, hobby/b, hobby/ew/configuration
    - timestat --prefix=work/
    - TIMESTAT_PREFIX
    - --filter work
    - easy renaming for the items in the hierarchy
    - warning when a new task is created
- review statistics, nicer outputs, aggregated week information
- comments:
    - [...] mywork # fixing bug 23 -- do I want this?
- normalization:
    - intervals should use hh:mm in action files
    - -H should be the default
